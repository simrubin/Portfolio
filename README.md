Welcome to Simeon Rubin's GitHub Repository

Hi there! 👋 I'm Simeon, a passionate designer and developer, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Design and Software Development at Monash University. This is a space for my coding projects, where I showcase a mix of creativity and technical expertise. 

💡 Exploring the intersection of design and technology, I've delved into various projects, from a ReactJS-based portfolio websiteto to an interface for a microcontroller touch display. 📱💻 My portfolio includes the development of ReactJS web applications, React-Native applications and an a Java turn-based game. Each of these projetcs are a testament to my curiosity and commitment to pushing the boundaries of my skill set.

🛠️ I've explored Google and OpenAI APIs, Tailwind CSS, and a variety of React libraries like Hero Icons, react-navigation, and Redux. 🌐 These tools have not only expanded my toolkit but have also fueled my passion for crafting innovative and user-friendly solutions.
I've also maintained a commitment to the SOLID principles in Object-Oriented Programming, ensuring my Java projects are easily extendable.

Feel free to explore my projects!
