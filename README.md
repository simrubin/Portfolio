# 🚀 Welcome to Simeon Rubin's GitHub Repository! 🚀

Hello there! 👋 I'm Simeon, a passionate and versatile developer currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Design and Software Development at Monash University. This space is a hub for my coding projects, where I showcase a blend of creativity and technical expertise.

💡 Exploring the intersection of design and technology, I've delved into various projects, from Android app development to a UI for a microcontroller touch display. 📱💻 My journey includes the development of two React Native clone applications, an Android app each a testament to my commitment to pushing the boundaries of my skill set.

🛠️ In the coding realm, I've ventured into the world of Google APIs, Sanity backend, Tailwind CSS, and a variety of React libraries like Hero Icons, react-navigation, and Redux. 🌐 These tools have not only expanded my toolkit but have also fueled my passion for crafting innovative and user-friendly solutions.
I've also maintained a commitment to the SOLID principles in Object-Oriented Programming, ensuring my Java projects are easily extendable.

Feel free to explore my projects and join me on this exciting coding journey! 🚧 Your feedback and collaboration are always welcome!🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻
