# Dragonborne Game
This game was developed as a group project by myself and 3 others for a university project. 
The aim was to apply good OO-design practive (with consideration for the SOLID principles) by extending a basic rogue-like game engine.
The game engine was supplied to us and we were tasking with adding to the functionality of the game whilst ensuring our code was useable and extendable.
